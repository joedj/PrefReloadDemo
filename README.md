(Fixed by c7a43af)

1. Visit Settings -> PrefsReloadDemo -> Activator and bind an action
2. Visit Settings -> PrefsReloadDemo and observe that triggering the action toggles the switch, and shows/hides the AppList button
3. Visit Settings -> PrefsReloadDemo -> Activator and observe that triggering the action messes with the Back button navigation (and possibly breaks other stuff)
4. Visit Settings -> PrefsReloadDemo -> AppList and observe that triggering the action resets all the switches from On -> Off (and probably breaks everything)
